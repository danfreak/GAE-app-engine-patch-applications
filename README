GAE-app-engine-patch-applications
----------------------------------

Some reusable applications that run on GAE (Google Application Engine - python version)
using app-engine-patch (http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/) for Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/)

I currently tested them with app-engine-patch-sample-1.0.zip for Django 1.0.2

The reusable applications include:

- myblog:
        a blog application including posts and pages (nested)
        
- photogallery:
        a photogallery application
- mycommon:
        some utilities (img resize etc shared by several applications)
        
Enjoiy!
